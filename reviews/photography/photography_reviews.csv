But this app is the best of art apps I've come across. The way the ads are presented in the free version do not interfere and occur in a unobtrusive way. It has more features than any similar app of it's genre and most can be used in the ad sponsored version.

Issue: A few years ago, I had purchased this application for $1 with the intentions that I was receiving this premium application without advertisements or premium memberships. Since then, the application is now free with the option of paying a monthly subscription which is why I had opted to purchase this application in the first place. I do understand that the application may not have made many sales through this approach but there was no notification of going free or any features offered to users that paid prior to this application becoming a free product.","April 12, 2019",1,"D33P STE4LTH"

When folks ask or mention needing a photo editor, I recommend Pixlr. However, my first and only issue is that it will not open and it wants close on me before I can touch anything. Please fix this, I don't want to use another more than Pixlr haha. Thank you ","December 8, 2018",4,"A Google user"

Then I realized there were editors that let you do your own smoothing instead of relying on their algorithms to do it and the other editors let you undo specific steps of an edit instead of an entire edit itself: i.e.: in pixlr, I may be on zit 452 and it doesn't look right so I tap the x bc there is no back button= starting over at zit #1.

Two things I feel are missing, are - a) More fonts! There is a variety, but it still feels very limiting in terms of typography; I would especially love to see more handwriting-type fonts. b) But even more importantly, as much as I love this app, I feel like the thing it could benefit the most from is photoshop-esq layers! It would make it so easy to go back and fix an editing mistake, to layer overlays in different ways and just make the edits better. Thank you.","October 8, 2018",4,"Noa K"

With this app we can not only edit images, but also there are tools such as video, pdf and webpage capture and batch processing. It is almost a full fledged photo editor. If possible, few minor improvements are needed, such as frame control in video capture for more precision and controls to capture particular section in a webpage, otherwise most of the page is getting cropped. Also, the save all option in text/image group is not saving the actual size of each item and so, after loading those layers, again I need to resize every item.

This app continually amazes me as I discover more and more functionality; even its 'features' have their own 'features'!! But PHOTO EDITOR is straightforward - it's FAR superior to anything I've ever used before, truly. I do a lot of image editing - down to pixel level, when I need it -- and PHOTO EDITOR will let you do that. You have command over, almost anything conceivable, in your working image. Initially, the interface may seem a bit confusing - it's not; it's just comprehensive as hell - however, and that's just the difference between professional, and non-professional, that's all.","October 28, 2018",5,"Dale Alan Bryant"

Basically has more options than even any payed ""pro"" app. A kinda shame on photos hop that they can not really offer as much in one app than this.

I would dare say that the raw power of the Note 8 married with the acuity/dexterity of the S Pen and combined with Photo Editor's exhaustive image processing capabilities allows a much more intuitive and precise way to edit photos than what even the vast majority of home PCs can offer. Photo Editor is perfect whether your pics need a quick touch-up or an all together all-over awe-inspiring transformation. Shape and Brush tools allow you to select where you wish to edit with pixel-by-pixel precision (or broad strokes at varying hardness settings) and every tool has sliders to adjust the intensity of the edits. For a mobile app the scale and flexibility to insert layers of images and text is bar-none, including importing .otf and .tff files for custom fonts. The sheer amount of options may be intimidating at first, but as you play around you soon learn the ropes and discover endless possibilities. I could praise Photo Editor all day, actually I have before, so really just download it.","October 14, 2018",5,"patrick morgan"

I use Fast stone image viewer on PC and was searching for a similar type of image editor. But never found it on android. But now i am very happy i finally found it. It's just too perfect. It has more than required options i wanted. Thank you for this great app.","October 14, 2018",5,"Naveen Dahiya"

Recent additions to the already-more-than-adequate list of features have brought its functionality to pretty much every other part of my various workflows that it hadn't already been involved with, and I've even found uses for it beyond the photo-related.

Like the setting, which never should have been a setting you had to deal with BEFORE you could start editting but rather should have always been an in editor tool so it could be changed if you needed or wanted to at any time during the editting of a single piece, which is setting the desktop background color to whatever YOU want it to be! Because whether you only use the white theme, the black theme, or the dark theme there are ALWAYS going to occur occasions in which either your beloved white or black desktop is going to be the exact same color as the primary edge color of the piece you need to be able to edit! And a white image on a white background, or black on black, makes this rather limited in-editor mode app hard as hell to work with since it vitually impossible to see the true edge of the image! But could always exit the editor, enter settings & rather than being forces to switch you theme from white to black or vice versa & hope half the borders aren't white & the half black which would makes today's version more than just annoying, it would making it an utter pain in the arse because there USED TO BE A SETTING TO PICK WHATEVER BLOODY COLOR YOU WANTED YOUR FRIGGING DESKTOP TO BE NO MATTER WHAT THEME YOU PREFERRED!! And for the longest I SAVED THAT OLD VERSION, turning off auto-updates on the Google Play Store way back when the idiot dev first STOLE that setting from me & CLAIMED HE WAS GOING TO BE ADDING IT AS A FEATURE WITHIN THE EDITOR SO USERS COULD CHANGE IT ON THE FLY! But did he EVER DO IT? OF COURSE NOT! And when I upgraded phones & the Play Store updated on my new one it decided to start back auto-updating ALL my apps including this one! Then, without me knowing that even happened, my system auto-backed-up all my new & updated apps & deleted all my old outdated one to space space! IOW: I GOT TOTALLY FUBARED NOT ONCE BUT TWICE NOW! THE DEV STOLE THE SETTING I PAID FOR & LIED BY CLAIMING HE WAS BRINGING IT BACK IN AN UPDATE, THEN FOR THE ETERNAL WANT OF NEWER, BETTER TECH I GOT FUBARED OUT OF MY PAID, BETTER VERSION OF THIS APP A SECOND FREAKING TIME! So what's the lesson, kids? Don't ever but anything you don't get a hardcopy of or that you yourself cannot & do not make a hardcopy of the instant you own it, because the person selling it to you will screw you every freaking time because you'll either pay'em for it again or piss on ya anyways! And if YOU'RE green enough to think this guy ain't like that & buy something without a hardcopy or of which a hardcopy cannot be made or you just don't make one, well then you WANTED to get screwed because YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SCREWED YOURSELF! Think about it!","October 13, 2018",2,"John Andrea La Russa"

EXTREMELY ANNOYING. I love this app. Honestly and thoroughly. When I attempt to *open from* my SD card, it tells me to select ""SD Card"" on the next screen. Upon getting to the next screen, it does not allow me the option of selecting my SD card. When I attempt to *save to* my SD card, I get the exact same prompt (asking me to ""select SD card"" on the next screen, when it gets to the next screen it only gives me the option to *save* the file I'm attempting to save... NO OPTION to select SD card first. If I proceed with saving the file (in whichever directory I'm using) it saves A FILE, with the correct name, in the correct place but it's corrupt (not recognizable, shows itself as *0.00 Bytes* in size as well. --Please fix or please explain to me what the issue is because other than this I ABSOLUTELY LOVE using this app, in all of its faculties.

I'm trying to figure out how to work things out. I think this app is a challenging app. I would not recommend this app to others. This app is hard to work with. I think this app would be hard for lower elementary. This app is very challenging for a 5th grader like me. This app is not an app people should be using. I would recommend to not upload this app on your phone or iPad. This app is a very challenging app like I said. Do not get this app, it's extremely confusing.

A couple of things that would make it so much better would be if while browsing through photos, the app would sort and group the pictures by day (or even location if pics have location tags). Secondly is if it had a quick slider bar for getting through a large amount of pictures faster. This would make finding old pictures to edit or creating collages with older pictures much easier and quicker.","May 6, 2019",4,"Ryan B"

I understand the limits of each app but still lacks some basic functions for eg- sketch won't allow a 90 rotation to help work on projects. having a landscape image that can't be viewed in landscape is very annoying. having to export it to PE just to rotate the image and then saving, opening again in sketch just to view it sideways. also something what should be simple but isnt is the cutting out and overlaying on layer image is another arduous task.","April 17, 2019",4,"John Day"

Isn't this the same program? If this was the case, why wasn't Gold membership offered right off-the-bat? Why wait until one membership is paid and then say, ""sorry, you have to pay more if you want the good features"".
